# InterCord

#### Author: Franciszek Łopuszański <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

## Disclaimer

The "InterCord" library is currently in its **early alpha** stage and is expected to be **very unstable**. Users should be aware that this version may contain significant bugs and incomplete features. There is no warranty provided with this software, and anyone who chooses to use "InterCord" does so at their own risk. We strongly advise against using this library in production environments or for critical applications at this time.

## Aim

"InterCord" is a versatile library designed to provide a uniform way to declare events and commands using middleware, ensuring seamless integration across various platforms. By being platform-agnostic, "InterCord" allows developers to trigger these events and commands regardless of the underlying platform. This design philosophy separates business logic from the trigger implementation, promoting cleaner, more maintainable code and enabling a more modular approach to application development.
