TODO:

- [x] Discord handlers
- [ ] Slack handlers
- [ ] REST handlers
- [x] Common command format
- [ ] Generic commands from other bots
- [ ] Stripe payment system
- [ ] Human check:
  - [ ] Captcha
  - [ ] Email verification
  - [ ] Retype secret
- [ ] Active pull server status
- [ ] Sharding
- [ ] Rust interop?
- [ ] Web dashboard
- [ ] Add embed handling
- [x] Unify event interface
- [ ] Mixins ?
- [ ] Unify command and event handler because they share to much in common( partially done )
- [ ] common_discord should be just part of generic handler as loading commands is similar regardless of platform like slack, discord, etc.
- [ ] Todo replace list of commands and events with key-value pairs to cleanup code and improve efficency
- [ ] Auto generate slack bot yaml for simple commands
